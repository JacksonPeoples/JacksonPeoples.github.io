My earliest memory of any career guidance came from a grade school English teacher who expressed her astonishment at my ability to see connections where others didn’t. I’ve always loved trying to find coherence or meaning in places where it’s not easily sussed out.

I find cleaning dirty data to be extremely satisfying and I love deciphering the story from the numbers and relaying it to others.

I'm looking for new opportunities in Data Science. If you have any leads, please don't hesitate to reach out:

When I'm not visualizing data or training models, I love running, cooking, playing guitar and watching football.
