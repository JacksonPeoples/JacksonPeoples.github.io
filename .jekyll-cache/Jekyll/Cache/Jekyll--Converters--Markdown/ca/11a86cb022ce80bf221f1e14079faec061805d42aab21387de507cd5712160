<p>Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death in the US for people aged 1-54 <a href="#1">[1]</a>. In Austin specifically, 88 people died in traffic accidents in 2019 <a href="#2">[2]</a>. While there are some promising reasons to think the rate of traffic accidents will decline in Austin (self-driving cars, improved public transit, etc), what could be done tomorrow to make an impact?</p>
