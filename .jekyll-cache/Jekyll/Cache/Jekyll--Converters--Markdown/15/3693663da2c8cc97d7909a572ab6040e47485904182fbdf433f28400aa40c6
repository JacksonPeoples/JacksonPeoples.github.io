I"»<p>My earliest memory of any career guidance came from a grade school English teacher who expressed her astonishment at my ability to see connections where otherâ€™s didnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve always loved trying to find coherence or meaning in places where itâ€™s not easily sussed out.</p>

<p>I find cleaning dirty data to be extremely satisfying and I love deciphering the story from the numbers and relaying it to others.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m looking for new opportunites in Data Science. If you have any leads, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out:</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not visualizing data and building predictive models, I love to run, cook, play guitar and watch football.</p>
