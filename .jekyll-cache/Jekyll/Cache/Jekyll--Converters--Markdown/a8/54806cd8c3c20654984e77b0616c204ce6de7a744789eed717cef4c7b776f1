<p>My earliest memory of any career guidance came from a grade school English teacher who expressed her astonishment at my ability to see connections where otherâ€™s didnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve always loved trying to find coherence or meaning in places where itâ€™s not easily sussed out.</p>

<p>This passion is leading me out of sales and into Data Science!</p>

<p>I find the problem solving of cleaning dirty data to be extremely satisfying and I love deciphering the story the numbers are telling and relaying it to others.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m looking for new opportunites in Data Science. If you have any leads, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!</p>
