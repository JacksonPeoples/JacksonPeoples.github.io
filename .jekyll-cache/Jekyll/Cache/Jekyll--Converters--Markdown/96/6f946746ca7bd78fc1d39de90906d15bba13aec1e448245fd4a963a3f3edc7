I"<p>My earliest memory of any career guidance came from a grade school English teacher who expressed her astonishment at my ability to see connections where other’s didn’t. I’ve always loved trying to find coherence or meaning in places where it’s not easily sussed out.</p>

<p>This passion is leading me out of sales and into Data Science!</p>

<p>I find the problem solving of cleaning dirty data to be extremely satisfying and I love deciphering the story the numbers are telling and relaying it to others.</p>

<p>I’m looking for new opportunites in Data Science. If you have any leads, please don’t hesitate to reach out!</p>
